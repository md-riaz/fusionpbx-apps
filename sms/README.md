18. For email delivery support, it uses the default setting email->smtp_from, so make sure that this is set appropriately.
19. For voicemail to sms support, it uses default setting voicem->voicemail_to_sms(boolean), so make sure that this is set to true. Also set voicemail_to_sms_did(text) to a valid sender phone number that will be used to send the voicemail messages.
20. For MMS email delivery, it will use the default setting sms->mms_attatement_temp_path, if this is set.  If not, it will try to use '/var/www/fusionpbx/app/sms/tmp/'
    as the temporary storage for the attachments.  Please make sure that you create the appropriate temp folder and change ownership to www-data/www-data.

NOTE: It is not recommended to use this app with versions of Freeswitch prior to 1.8 if you are installing in a clustered environment.  
There is a bug in earlier versions of Freeswitch that can cause it to crash in certain situation when using SMS.
